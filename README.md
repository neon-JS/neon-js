## About

Hi. ‚úåüèª   
I'm Curly (_he/they_), a backend developer from the Lower Rhine region in Germany.
At my job at `{{ job.company.name }}`, I mainly work on a PHP (8) backend that is almost the same age as me. 
Therefore, my relationship to PHP is ‚Ä¶ a bit ‚Ä¶ biased and you likely won't see any PHP stuff here.
Infrequently, I get to work on our .NET backend, principally to stay somewhat sane.

I also gained some knowledge of Docker and basic server administration during work as well. 

Off-work I like to play around with Rust and Linux (arch btw).

## Languages, stacks and tools
#### Proficient
- C# in combination with .NET (3+), EF Core and xUnit
- PHP 7+ and PHPUnit
- HTML
- ECMAScript (mainly for Node.js)
- Relational databases like MariaDB
- Git, Git flow, GitHub

#### Basic to advanced knowledge (depends on who you're asking)
- Server management and configuration (e.g. nginx, ssh, fail2ban, ufw, docker compose)
- Rust
- Docker
- Angular

## Projects
My GitHub projects are mostly created for personal use and therefore aren't always in active development or even production-ready.
I try to update them now and then to keep them usable.
If you want to use one of them or need an extension, feel free to create an issue or fork them directly. üòä

#### License
The projects are usually licensed under the MIT license.
This means you can basically do whatever you want with the code but I can't be liable if things go south.

## Any questions?
Write me an email!
