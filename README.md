## About

Hi. ✌🏻   
I'm Curly (_he/they_) and I'm a software developer from the lower rhine region in Germany.   
As I'm working on `{{ job.company.name }}`s backend using mostly C# / 
.NET Core, I'd say that this is probably my go-to language.   
(Sometimes I'm "asked" to write some PHP but let's pretend I didn't say this. 😉)  
That said, I also play around with other languages like Rust, Swift, 
or sometimes C for Arduino stuff.  
I've incidentally gained some knowledge of Docker and basic server administration 
during work as well. 

## Languages & stacks
I'd claim that I'm pretty proficient with the following languages or stacks:
- C# in combination with .NET Core 3+
- PHP 7+
- MySQL / MariaDB
- ECMAScript / TypeScript (mainly for node.js)
- German

## Projects
My Github projects are mostly created for personal use and therefore aren't always 
in active development or even production ready.  
I try to update them every now and then to keep them usable.    
If you want to use one of them or need an extension, feel free to create an issue or fork them directly. 😊
