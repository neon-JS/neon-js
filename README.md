## About

Hi. ‚úåüèª   
I'm Curly (_he/they_), a backend developer from the Lower Rhine in Germany.   
At my job at `{{ job.company.name }}`, I mainly work on a PHP (8) backend but I'd say that  
C# (in combination with the .NET framework) is probably my go-to language.   

That said, I like to play around with other languages like Rust or sometimes (even) C for  
Arduino stuff. I also gained some knowledge of Docker and basic server administration  
during work as well. 

## Languages, stacks and tools
#### Proficient
- C# in combination with .NET (3+), EF Core and xUnit
- PHP 7+ and PHPUnit
- HTML
- JavaScript (mainly for node.js)
- Relational Databases like MySQL and MariaDB
- Git & Github

#### Basic to advanced knowledge (depends on who you're asking)
- Server management & configuration (e.g. nginx, ssh, fail2ban, ufw, docker compose)
- Angular
- Rust
- Docker

## Projects
My Github projects are mostly created for personal use and therefore aren't always in  
active development or even production-ready. I try to update them now and then to keep  
them usable. If you want to use one of them or need an extension, feel free to create an  
issue or fork them directly. üòä

#### License
The projects are usually licensed under the MIT license. This means you can basically do  
whatever you want with the code but I can't be liable if things go south.

## Any questions?
Write me a mail!
